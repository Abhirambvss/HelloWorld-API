To achieve this efficiently, you can use the `StreamReader` method to read the CSV file line by line and perform the search operation. For each line, split it into columns and check if the value in the specified column matches any value from your array of search values. If it does, retrieve the other column values from that line.

Here's an example of how you can approach this in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Define the array of values to search
$searchValues = @("value1", "value2", "value3")  # Add your search values here

# Define the column index to search in (assuming it's the first column, change as needed)
$searchColumnIndex = 0

# Define your processing logic here
function Process-Data($line) {
    $data = $line.Split(',')  # Split the line by comma (assuming CSV)
    
    # Check if the value in the specified column matches any search value
    if ($searchValues -contains $data[$searchColumnIndex]) {
        # Output the other column values from the line
        # Adjust column indices based on your CSV structure
        $otherValues = $data[1..($data.Length - 1)] -join ','  # Remaining column values
        
        # Output the matched line data (or perform other operations)
        Write-Output "Match found: $otherValues"
    }
}

# Reading the file using StreamReader
$file = "path\to\your\file.csv"
$reader = [System.IO.File]::OpenText($file)

# Process the file data in parallel
$reader | ForEach-Object -Parallel {
    Process-Data $_
} -ThrottleLimit 5 # Adjust the throttle limit as needed

$reader.Close()
```

This script reads the CSV file line by line and checks if the value in the specified column matches any of the values in the search array. If a match is found, it retrieves the remaining column values from that line. Adjust the column indices and search criteria according to your CSV file's structure and the specific column you want to search within.


Reading a CSV file in parallel using PowerShell can be achieved by splitting the workload across multiple threads or processes. PowerShell inherently doesn't support parallel processing of CSV files directly via `StreamReader`. However, you can achieve parallelism using PowerShell Jobs or Runspaces.

Here's an example using PowerShell Jobs:

```powershell
# Define the function to process rows
function ProcessCSVRows($startRow, $endRow) {
    $csvData = Import-Csv -Path "yourfile.csv" | Select-Object -Index ($startRow..$endRow)
    # Process the data here
    $csvData
}

# Define the number of rows to process in each job
$rowBlockSize = 10000
$totalRows = 600000

# Loop through the CSV in chunks
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $totalRows; $i += $rowBlockSize) {
    $startRow = $i
    $endRow = [Math]::Min($i + $rowBlockSize - 1, $totalRows - 1)

    # Start a new job to process a chunk of rows
    Start-Job -ScriptBlock ${function:ProcessCSVRows} -ArgumentList $startRow, $endRow | Wait-Job | Receive-Job
}
```

This script divides the CSV file into chunks of 10,000 rows and processes each chunk in a separate PowerShell Job. You might need to adapt the "Process the data here" part to suit your specific processing needs.

Remember, the actual execution time might vary based on your system's resources and the complexity of operations performed on the CSV data. Additionally, managing parallel jobs efficiently requires consideration of resource constraints and synchronization, depending on the nature of your task.
